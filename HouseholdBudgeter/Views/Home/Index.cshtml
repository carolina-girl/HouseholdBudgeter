        A financial portal built using Microsoft MVC, Entity Framework, Code-First database creation, LINQ, and SQL.
        The Household Budgeter is a Web-based software application designed for creating and managing budgets for
        household finances and the balancing of bank accounts.
        It functions as an online service that may be used in multiple households/families throughout the world.

        The Household Budgeter project is similar in nature to many such commercial-grade products
        (i.e. AceMonkey, BudgetPulse, Moneydance, Pocketsmith, QuickBooks, EveryDollar, etc.),
        which most employers are familiar.
